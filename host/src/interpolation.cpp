// Frame interpolation help, called from hooks in conker.toml.
//
// RT64 draws frames between the game's by pairing each transform with one from the
// previous frame. Without help it guesses, from draw calls that look alike, and the
// game batches a character's triangles differently from frame to frame, so some of
// Conker's parts were paired with others and jumped about. func_1502CCFC draws a game
// object (from gObjects) into a display list: its commands are wrapped in an RT64
// matrix group whose ID names the object, with linear ordering, so the n-th matrix
// of an object is always paired with the n-th of the same object last frame. An
// object whose count of matrices changed (a character's mesh is drawn in chunks, one
// bone's matrix each, cut differently as its animation changes) has each matrix paired
// with last frame's closest instead, its vertices left as they are (rt64.patch,
// GameFrame::alignTransforms; pairing none of them made Conker snap, issue #76).
//
// A character's shadow (func_15186794) is the ground under it, clipped anew every
// frame and drawn with the shadow's texture projected onto it: its own group asks RT64
// to interpolate its texture coordinates from last frame's projection (rt64.patch),
// so the shadow slides with the character instead of stepping at the game's rate.
// The silhouette in the shadow's texture is drawn from a camera the game aims at the character
// anew every frame, its distance and zoom changing together; RT64 interpolates that camera whole
// (rt64.patch, ProjectionProcessor), as taken apart and put together halfway it drew the shadow
// larger (issue #76).
//
// A shadow isn't drawn on the first game frame it's back after frames without it (issue
// #75). Walking into a room, the game draws no shadow while the room loads, then for
// one frame lays the shadow from where Conker was before the room switched over onto
// the new room's ground: a big patch of it, only the dark middle of the shadow's texture
// on it. Measured (RT64's shadows logged, frame by frame): the shadow back after the
// gap was a 90-vertex patch at the wrong height, the next one a normal 28-vertex patch
// on the floor 160 units away. The game draws it so at 30 FPS too, so it isn't the
// smoothing; on the frame after, all is right. Anywhere else a shadow shows up a frame
// late, 1/30 of a second, after a cutscene or a load.
