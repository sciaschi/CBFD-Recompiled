// Graphics: Conker's Detail, Conker kept at his most detailed model (called from a hook in conker.toml).
//
// Each character has a few models, from the most detailed down, and every game frame
// func_1502C6E8 picks one for each object by how far it is from the camera: under 500 units
// the first (level 0), then further levels at the distances in D_80096DE0 and D_80096DE4, and
// past 2000 the last. Nearly still (xz speed, +0x3C, under 3) a level from 2 on is moved one
// closer. Two flags override it: D_800C35EA set to 1 makes every object level 0, and in the
// multiplayer arenas (D_800BE616, set by func_15015F40 for scenes 26, 36, 43, 45, 48, 51, 52 and
// 63, with the player count) a character whose first model is 0, Conker, is kept at level 1.
// The level is clamped to the object's models (+0x2C8 is their count), and when it changed the
// new model is loaded (func_150837D4, with the model's number from the list at +0x2C4; the
// loaded one is then at +0x4) and the level stored at +0x1C8. An object whose level the game
// sets itself (+0x1C9, func_1502FBE8) isn't picked for.
//
// Conker is object 0, his models 0 to 4. Measured (each level picked logged as he walked about
// the first room of a save): he flipped between level 0 and 1 as the camera's distance crossed
// 500, and between 1 and 2 each time he started or stopped walking, from the nearly-still rule.
// With Always Highest he stays at level 0 in single player; multiplayer keeps the original's
// level 1, which the game chose for its split screens.
