// func_151408A4 draws a glow over a light, fading it out while something stands in front
// of it. It finds that by having the RDP copy the one pixel of the depth buffer under the
// light into memory (its display list gets the pixel's x and y), then, the next frame,
// decoding that sample (D_80089630: the N64's depth format) and comparing it with the
// light's own depth: more than 31 behind the sample, and the glow fades out. RT64 draws
// depth on the GPU, and that sample doesn't come back as the N64's depth, so glows faded
// out wrongly (lit near the light, gone a little way off). The comparison is skipped: a
// glow on screen is shown. (The same function's 4:3 bounds check is widened for widescreen in
// widescreen.cpp.)
